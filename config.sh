HOME="YOUR_HOME_PATH_HERE" # Path for ~, recommended to set to the root directory of GMEvalKit_dev to control some cache paths
HF_HOME="YOUR_HF_CACHE_PATH_HERE" # Replace with your desired Hugging Face cache path, e.g., "/home/username/.cache/huggingface"
HF_ENDPOINT="https://huggingface.co" # You can change to mirror endpoint such as https://hf-mirror.com if needed

Please adjust according to your actual GPU memory size and the number of GPUs available. For example, if you are using A100 with 80GB GPUs, it is recommended to set t2ireasonbench from 2 to 4 GPUs to ensure Qwen2.5-VL-72B can run successfully.)
