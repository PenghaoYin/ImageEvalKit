Translating this visually: inexperienced staff can be represented as young, nervous or confused workers (e.g., people in casual or mismatched clothing, holding paperwork upside-down). Poor planning can be symbolized by messy or random placement of important tools and instructions scattered across a workplace. 'Recipe for disaster' could be depicted as a kitchen scene where unqualified individuals attempt cooking, resulting in exaggerated chaos (e.g., smoke, spilled ingredients, broken utensils). This conveys the message with concrete elements."

Ingredients are scattered on the floor, pots are boiling over, and smoke pours from the oven.
